    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. <br>
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. <br>
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br> 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. <br>
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br> 
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. <br>
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. <br>
            Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
            Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. <br> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. <br> 
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. <br> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up. <br>
        </li>
    </ol>
