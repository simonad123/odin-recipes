    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baklava is a delicious Greek pastry dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, chopped nuts, and honey syrup that's so easy to make. <br>
       A Greek friend showed me how to make this fabulous recipe. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). <br>
            Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.
        </li>
        <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. </li>
        <li>
            Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. <br>
            Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. <br> 
            Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly with a pastry brush. <br>
            Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. <br>
            Top with two sheets of dough, melted butter, nuts, layering as you go. <br> 
            The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. <br>
            You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. <br>
            Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp. <br> 
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. <br>
            Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. </li>
        <li>Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
